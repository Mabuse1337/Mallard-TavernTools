List and description of included cards:

## Narrator of Stories Past

- **Style**: Second-person past tense narration  
- **Tone**: Grounded, neutral, psychologically realistic  
- **Usage**: Ideal for traditional storytelling where events are narrated after they've occurred. Maintains tight control of pacing and avoids improvising details not initiated by the player.

## Narrator of Stories Present

- **Style**: Second-person present tense narration  
- **Tone**: Observational, restrained, immersive  
- **Usage**: Suitable for interactive, real-time storytelling where the player character is observed in the moment. Responds only to direct input and avoids suggesting player thoughts or actions.
